Python Control Systems Toolbox
==============================

The `control-toolbox` is a Python Library for implementing and simulating various systems and control strategies.

.. rubric:: Current Supported Functionality:

- System modeling with Transfer Functions and State Space models.
- Time Domain Response of System with the following input signals: Impulse, Step, Ramp.
- System conversion, State Space model to Transfer Function
- Block diagram algebra: Series and Paralel.
- Stability analysis of the system.
- Root Locus Plot of the system.
- Frequency Response, Bode plot.
- Parameterization of systems.
- Pole-Zero Plot of systems.
- Feedback analysis.
- PID control.
- Observability, Controllability.

.. rubric:: Future Updates:

- Linear Quadratic Regulator.
- Kalman Filter.
