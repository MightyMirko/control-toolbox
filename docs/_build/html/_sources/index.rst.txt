Python Control Systems Toolbox
==============================

The `control-toolbox` is a Python Library for implementing and simulating various systems and control strategies.

.. rubric:: Current Supported Functionality:

- System modeling with Transfer Functions (State Space models coming in future updates).
- Time Domain Response of System with the following input signals: Impulse, Step, Ramp.
- Pole-Zero Plot of system.
- Root Locus Plot of the system.
- Stability analysis of the system.

.. rubric:: Future Updates:

- Block diagram algebra.
- Frequency response: Bode and Polar Plots.
- Observability, Controllability.
- Linear Quadratic Regulator.
- Kalman Filter.
